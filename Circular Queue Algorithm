    Create an integer array called CQUE to represent the circular queue and initialize FRONT and REAR to -1.

    Display a menu to the user with the following options:
        Press 1 to enqueue an element.
        Press 2 to dequeue an element.
        Press 3 to display the elements in the circular queue.
        Press 4 to search for an element in the circular queue.
        Press 5 to exit the program.

    Accept the user's choice as input.

    If the user chooses 1 to enqueue:
        Check if the circular queue is full:
            If full, display "QUEUE IS FULL."
            If not full, prompt the user for an item and add it to the circular queue using the circular increment for REAR.

    If the user chooses 2 to dequeue:
        Check if the circular queue is empty:
            If empty, display "QUEUE IS EMPTY."
            If not empty, remove the front item from the circular queue using the circular increment for FRONT.

    If the user chooses 3 to display the circular queue:
        Check if the circular queue is empty:
            If empty, display "QUEUE IS EMPTY."
            If not empty, iterate through the circular queue and display each element.

    If the user chooses 4 to search for an element:
        Check if the circular queue is empty:
            If empty, display "QUEUE IS EMPTY."
            If not empty, prompt the user for an element to search for, and iterate through the circular queue to find it.

    If the user chooses 5, exit the program.

    Repeat the menu and operations until the user chooses to exit.
